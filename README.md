# TUR Issues
Welcome! This git repository is the primary issue tracker for all bug reports (and feature requests!) related to the Tony's Unreal Realm UT2k4 server and all of its mods. All input and feedback is welcome, but please read further regarding the standard procedures for providing so.

# Reporting Issues
An issue template is in use for both bug reports and feature requests. Please try to adhere to these templates as much as possible and where applicable. Minor deviations are fine, but keep in mind that the closer your issue submission is to the template the further through gate 1 the issue is. Below are general guidelines for each issue template for each type of issue recognized.

## Bug Reports
### Title
Please title your issue report something brief and meaningful that is related to the bug. The title should be brief and provide a clear understanding and emphasis on the major points of the issue.</br>

A good example would be: `"Rocket Launcher projectiles do not damage enemies"`</br>
A bad example would be: `"Can't hurt monsters"`

### Issue Description
#### Steps to Reproduce
This is the most important part of the bug report, as this tells the developer what to do in order to reproduce the bug. The more likely the developer is able to reproduce the bug, the more likely it will be fixed.</br>

Precisely describe each step taken to reproduce the bug. Try to include as much information as possible, even if you think it's unnecessary. Even the most minor information can be crucial.</br>

A good example would be:
```
1. Play as Weapons Master on Wave 1.
2. Obtain a Rocket Launcher
3. Wait until enemy monsters begin spawning.
4. Shoot at enemy monsters with Rocket Launcher primary fire.
5. Observe as the monsters do not take any damage.
```
A bad example would be:
```
1. Shoot at enemies with a weapon and see that they do not hurt them
```

#### Actual and Expected Results
This is to make sure everybody is on the same page. Provide here with your bug report a summary of what you expected to happen when you encountered the bug as opposed to what *actually* happened.</br>

A good example would be:
```
Like for all weapons, I expected the Rocket Launcher projectiles to damage monsters and eventually kill them, however upon further inspection it appears that the rockets in fact do no damage and the enemy monsters will therefore never be killed.
```
A bad example would be:
```
Rockets dont hurt enemies wtfff
```

#### Additional Information
If applicable, you should provide any additional information possible related to the issue. These types of materials are often requested on the basis of different bug reports in order to help track down the issue much quicker. If your issue is related to a persistent crash, please consider attaching your game logs. If the issue can be observed in-game, please consider attaching screenshots showing the bug in action. Use your best judgement when attaching additional information.
