# TUR Issues
Welcome! This git repository is the primary issue tracker for all bug reports (and feature requests!) related to the Tony's Unreal Realm UT2k4 server and all of its mods. All input and feedback is welcome, but please read further regarding the standard procedures for providing so.

# Reporting Issues
An issue template is in use for both bug reports and feature requests. Please try to adhere to these templates as much as possible and where applicable. Minor deviations are fine, but keep in mind that the closer your issue submission is to the template the further through gate 1 the issue is. Below are general guidelines for each issue template for each type of issue recognized.

## Bug Reports
If you found a problem or otherwise unexpected outcome of some event in-game (otherwise known as a bug), please report it! Reporting bugs is how problems with the game get fixed and therefore create a better gameplay experience for both you and everyone else.
### Title
Please title your issue report something brief and meaningful that is related to the bug. The title should be brief and provide a clear understanding and emphasis on the major points of the issue.</br>

A good example would be: `"Rocket Launcher projectiles do not damage enemies"`</br>
A bad example would be: `"Can't hurt monsters"`

### Summary
Provide a brief summary of the bug. Explain in clear and concise language what the bug is and how it affects gameplay.

### Steps to Reproduce
This is the most important part of the bug report, as this tells the developer what to do in order to reproduce the bug. The more likely the developer is able to reproduce the bug, the more likely it will be fixed.</br>

Precisely describe each step taken to reproduce the bug. Try to include as much information as possible, even if you think it's unnecessary. Even the most minor information can be crucial.</br>

A good example would be:
```
1. Play as Weapons Master on Wave 1.
2. Obtain a Rocket Launcher
3. Wait until enemy monsters begin spawning.
4. Shoot at enemy monsters with Rocket Launcher primary fire.
5. Observe as the monsters do not take any damage.
```
A bad example would be:
```
1. Shoot at enemies with a weapon and see that they do not hurt them
```

### Actual and Expected Results
This is to make sure everybody is on the same page. Provide here with your bug report a summary of what you expected to happen when you encountered the bug as opposed to what *actually* happened.</br>

A good example would be:
```
Like for all weapons, I expected the Rocket Launcher projectiles to
damage monsters and eventually kill them, however upon further inspection
it appears that the rockets in fact do no damage and the enemy monsters
will therefore never be killed.
```
A bad example would be:
```
Rockets dont hurt enemies wtfff
```

### Additional Information
If applicable, you should provide any additional information possible related to the issue. These types of materials are often requested on the basis of different bug reports in order to help track down the issue much quicker. If your issue is related to a persistent crash, please consider attaching your game logs. If the issue can be observed in-game, please consider attaching screenshots showing the bug in action. Use your best judgement when attaching additional information.

### Possible Solution
This is not required, but if you can think of a way to fix the bug, provide your best idea for a solution to the problem.

## Feature Requests
### Title
Give your feature request a title. The title should be brief and provide a clear understanding of the feature you are requesting. It should provide emphasis on the major points of the new feature.</br>

A good example would be: `"Add Enhanced Weapons to weapon rotations"`
A bad example would be: `"Need new weapons"`

### Feature Description
Provide a detailed description of the feature you are requesting. It should be clear and concise while maintaining as much information about the feature as possible. Be sure to include details including how your new feature works and any special considerations that should be made, where appropriate. Remember that the more information you provide, the higher chance that your feature will be considered! You should also briefly explain why you think this feature is necessary.</br>

A good example would be:
```
The Enhanced Weapon pack should be added to the weapon rotation.
These weapons provide some much needed extra firepower and variety to
the lack thereof seen in the current weapon selection. The weapons
should be available to everyone and therefore be part of the standard
weapon rotation as opposed to exclusive abilities or other means. I
feel that the current variety and utility of the weapon rotation is
lackluster, and the Enhanced Weapon pack provides an all-around
upgrade to these lacking areas while also being relatively balanced and
not too powerful for typical gameplay.
```
A bad example would be:
```
current weapons suck there should be some new ones. trust me dude
```

### Additional Information
If applicable, you should provide any additional information possible related to your new feature. Here is where you can provide supplementary materials to include mockup artwork, screenshots, log files, other types of media, and so forth where applicable.
